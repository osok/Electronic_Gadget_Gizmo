#Idea
Create box that puzzles those that inquire.  
With the exception of a few rules make it such that even though it's open source it's still challenging.

Considering that others might write how to's, to defeat it.  Shameful as it might be, reading it would be more so. :-)
Its important that any how to can at most give hints and not the actual flag, 
only provide some assistance for the weak minded that cannot handle the challenge.

#Levels of play
*Super l33t - Tell me nothing, don't even let me on this site
*Expert - Let me know what's on this page
*Script Kiddie - Let me look around this site
*N00b - Let me look for a cheat-sheet or ask someone (Still not going to solve it for you)

Yes, even if you solve the entire box, if you used cheat-sheets then you're still a N00b, not even rising to the elvel of Script Kiddie.

#Inspiration
I like challenges and I like to challenge others.
I had an extended break over the Holidays in 2016 and decided what better way to solidify a number of skills that I had not exercised in a few years.

#Premise
There is a box, with a LCD Screen, buttons and a lock.
There are 5 flags, each unique to the box, set at firmware load.
Each flag consist of three stages.
*Stage 1 : Easy, you should be able to figure this out.
*Stage 2 : The Warmer, this is a little more challenging.
*Stage 3 : Evil, It's stage three so it has to be more difficult that stage 2, enough said.


#Requirements
## Overall Project
I wanted to create something that would inspire others to do the same, using what ever they needed from this one to get theirs build.  
Hopefully, the stages and flags are different in future boxes.  I got lucky, I got some of the easy ones.  It's only fair I thought of the idea.
Some of the flags might be the same, but have different stages.

##This box's requirements
With out giving away what's inside (I guess you could look at the code or eagle board and get an idea, not that I think you should)
* I wanted to figure out GitHub (I'm an old school programmer, like 8 years since I did team development)
* I wanted to build some Arduino Libraries for some of the code I already wrote and use it in the project
* I wanted to code multiple devices on SPI and I2C bus
* I wanted to provide a fun tool that could be used to educate, challenge and expose people to new ways of thinking
* I also wanted to frustrate those that could not or would not "Try Harder"

#Rules
*You cannot cut, drill use hot gun, heat source or any other means to gain access into the box, until the flag is reach that says you can open it.  It is Not locked.
*You cannot drill out the screws or buttons.
*When you get to "That Point" (You know which one I means).  Don't throw, smash, crush, incinerate or otherwise destroy the box
